# Fiscal Code Generator

A really simple chrome extension that generates a random italian fiscal code.

The tool will only generate fiscal codes for people over the age of 18

This tool should only be used for generating fiscal codes used in testing. The fiscal code's it generates may or may not belong to a real person.

I have published this tool on the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fiscal-code-generator/nlcnmipokibkidjcgeomjlhmlaepgkei)
